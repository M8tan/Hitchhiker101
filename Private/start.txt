Absolutely, I’d love to help you build this project — it’s a great way to learn full-stack development and get hands-on experience with modern tools and technologies like Go, Docker, Jenkins, and more.

Let’s break this down into features, tech stack, and a step-by-step project plan so you can build it yourself with full understanding.

🔧 Project: City Info Web App
🌐 Features

Search Cities (with autocomplete)

City General Information

Weather Info (API)

Currency Converter (API)

Local Time + Timezone Converter

AI Assistant (Simple chatbot)

Clean UI using HTML/CSS

Responsive Frontend with TypeScript

Optional Backend (Node.js or Go)

CI/CD with Jenkins + GitHub

Dockerized App for easy deployment

🧱 Tech Stack
Component	Tech/Tool
Frontend	HTML, CSS, TypeScript, JavaScript
Autocomplete / UI	Vanilla JS or small library like Alpine.js
Backend (optional)	Go or Node.js (Express/Fiber/Gin)
Weather API	OpenWeatherMap / WeatherAPI
Currency API	ExchangeRate-API / fixer.io
Timezone API	worldtimeapi.org or timezonedb
AI Assistant	Simple rule-based JS or OpenAI API
DB (Optional)	SQLite or PostgreSQL
DevOps	Git + GitHub + Jenkins + Docker
🗺️ Step-by-Step Plan
🔹 Step 1: Plan Your Data

What info do you want per city?

Population?

Country?

Map?

Use a static dataset or fetch from an API (e.g. GeoDB Cities API)

🔹 Step 2: Set Up Your Frontend

Basic HTML + CSS layout

Input field with autocomplete

Div sections for:

Weather

Currency

Time

City Info

AI Assistant

Use TypeScript for main logic, and bundle with esbuild or Vite.

🔹 Step 3: Fetch APIs

Use Fetch API in the frontend, or use a backend proxy if needed.

Example:

🌤 Weather: OpenWeatherMap

💱 Currency: ExchangeRate API

🕒 Time: World Time API

🔹 Step 4: Add Autocomplete

Use a small dataset or fetch from GeoDB Cities API

JS logic: match input with cities → show dropdown → onClick → populate city info

🔹 Step 5: Add AI Assistant

Start simple:

A chatbot-style text box

JS handles Q&A:

"What's the weather in Paris?" → triggers weather fetch

"Convert 100 USD to EUR" → triggers currency fetch

Optional: Integrate OpenAI API for natural responses

🔹 Step 6: Backend (Optional)

Use Go or Node.js to:

Act as a proxy (secure API keys)

Store favorite cities

Log user queries

Provide APIs to the frontend

e.g. GET /weather?city=Paris → fetch from OpenWeather → return JSON

🔹 Step 7: Dockerize It

Dockerfile for frontend (static site or Node server)

Dockerfile for backend (Go/Node)

Optional Docker Compose

🔹 Step 8: CI/CD with Jenkins

Jenkinsfile: Lint, test, build Docker image, deploy

GitHub integration (webhooks)

Deploy to local server or cloud (DigitalOcean, etc.)

🔹 Step 9: Polish UI

Responsive CSS

Use icons (e.g. FontAwesome
, Weather icons
)

Dark mode?

🔹 Step 10: Final Touches

SEO

Loading spinners

Error handling

Save recent searches (localStorage or backend)

🚀 Want Help with a Specific Step?

Let me know where you'd like to start:

Want me to scaffold the basic HTML/TS/CSS for you?

Want a Dockerfile template?

Want help with OpenWeatherMap integration?

Or just the GitHub + Jenkins + Docker setup?

We can go part by part.

Let’s build it together! 💪
